### smartPins

Safari's pinned sites are dumb by default: they don't react when there's new content in your tabs, and seem to let websites ruin icon consistency.

How about we fix that?

This is a SIMBL plugin to does just that.

## How to Install

### El Capitan (OS X 10.11)

Here's the guide for installing SIMBL on El Capitan: https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL/issues/26#issuecomment-117028426

After that, [download smartPins](https://github.com/inket/smartPins/releases), extract it, and place `smartPins.bundle` in `/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/`

##### For advanced users

Obviously, there is no need to disable SIP (and reboot 4+ times). If you can extract SIMBL from the .pkg, boot into Recovery or any other OS, then you can simply copy the SIMBL's files to the correct paths.
